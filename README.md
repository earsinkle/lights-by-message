# Lights By Message

An implementation of the lights out game in Phoenix Liveview, based on [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrpulBR5PFg).
The goal of this project is to expand upon that by adding URL parameters to set the initial board state and allowing people to create and share Lights Out puzzles through a generated link.

## Instructions:

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
